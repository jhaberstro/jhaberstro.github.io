                    <p> We chose the Berkshires for it’s beauty and relative conveniece for all the people we
                        love (California excluded, sorry guys). Chloe visited many.. many... venues and fell in love with Gedney Farm. Best of
                        all, Chloe’s cousin Sarah got engaged at Gedney! Jedd visited a month later and it was a done
                        deal!</p>

                    <h3 class="cover-section-subtitle title">Wait... What do you mean no cell service?</h3>
                    <p>Oh... yeah... that... New Marlborough is wonderful and full of charm, but it is not full of bars.
                        Cell phones struggle in most parts of the town, most especially our venue. That said, it will be
                        THE most beautiful time of year and we’ll be spending so much time connecting and creating
                        community, will you really notice?</p>
                    <p>Ok, I know you’ll notice. Here’s some tips:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Use wifi — your hotel, Airbnb, and Gedney Farm will all have wifi. Use the wifi to blow
                                me up on Instastories (@chloeamorel #haberstrong #influencer
                                #haberstrobreaktheinternet), connect to maps, and look up restaurants.</li>
                            <li>Plug into GPS while on wifi — if you enter a destination and hit go while connected to
                                wifi, it will continue directing you even when wifi isn’t available.</li>
                            <li>Use the map we will provide in our formal invitation — a beautiful map with restaurants, the
                                ADORABLE country store, and more is coming. Bring it with you— New Marlborough is a big
                                circle, so if you know where you’re going this is an awesome time to try to navigate
                                without your phone (like the early settlers or the Oregon trail. Fun!)</li>
                        </ol>

                    <h3 class="cover-section-subtitle title">Why isn’t so-and-so invited?</h3>
                    <p>Chloe wanted a 250 person wedding with a big band. Jedd wanted to have 25 people in someone’s back yard. We compromised and landed on gedney! That said, we are limiting our wedding to around 100 people… which was hard. There are some folks we were not able to invite and will need to celebrate with later.</p>

                    <h3 class="cover-section-subtitle title">Can I bring my kiddos?</h3>
                    <p>We love your little ones! Our wedding, however, will be an adults only affair. We are happy to help you find a local babysitter and connect you with other families who may be bringing children to enjoy the Berkshires for the weekend.</p>

                    <h3 class="cover-section-subtitle title">Or a plus one/my dog?</h3>
                    <p>The folks invited to the wedding will be clearly marked on your invitation (coming in 2020). If you have a plus one, you’ll know it based on your invitation. Unfortunately we don’t have the space or the benjamins for more people (and only service animals, please).</p>

                    <h3 class="cover-section-subtitle title">What should I wear?</h3>
                    <p>We’ll be outside for the ceremony (weather permitting) then in a super cool barn. So, think Barn
                        Chic, Barn Fabulous, Barn Formal— whatever floats your boat and makes you feel your best!</p>

                    <h3 class="cover-section-subtitle title">Do I really need a car?</h3>
                    <p>Le sigh... We wish it weren’t so. New Marlborough is pretty remote so if you’re flying in we highly recommend grabbing a rental car. We can connect you with people you may want to make friends with if you are interested in sharing a rental car! </p>

                    <p>We put together a registry of suggestions and as a guide to our style as a couple. We cherish gifts from the heart, handmade gifts, and things we can love for years to come. Items passed down through the generations or things you enjoyed from your own wedding-- those will be the most meaningful to us. Have an end table from your great great grandmother or a vase you got at your own wedding that you loved for years but don't have space for? Write out the story and pass it on happily. Please consider your own skills and gifts when thinking of something to give to us, not the dollar value on our registry. We love you!</p>
